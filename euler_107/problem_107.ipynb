    "[This problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=107) asks us to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) in a weighted network, then calculate the savings by pruning the graph to this MST. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement Kruskal's algorithm, which seems to be a classic in the canon of algorithms that CS majors learn.  However it is simply a particular case of the **greedy algorithm** for maximizing a weight function over a [matroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid). In this case, the matroid $M$ is the collection of sets of edges not containing a cycle, and the bases of this matroid are the spanning trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a theorem of Rado that the greedy algorithm produces an optimal set over a family of sets $M$ if an only if $M$ is a matroid. In fact, the greedy algorithm completely classifies classical matroids. Let's verify this for the very specific case where we are using the greedy algorithm to construct a minimum spanning tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our ground set in this case is the set of edges $E = \\{ (v,w) \\in V\\times V \\}$ of a graph $G$ on $V$, and we call a set of edges *independent* if it does not contain a cycle. Maximal indpendent sets, or bases, are spanning trees $\\mathcal{T}$.     In this context, the **basis exchange property** says that given two trees, $T$ and $S$, if $g\\in T \\setminus S$ then there should be an $f\\in S\\setminus T$ such that $T+f-g$ is also a tree. Let's verify that $\\mathcal{T}$ is indeed a basis of a matroid. \n",
    "\n",
    "* *If $e\\in S\\setminus T $ then removing it creates connected components partitioning $Vert(G)=A\\sqcup B$.   Since $T$ is a spanning tree, there must an edge $f\\in T$ connecting $A$ and $B$, however this edge cannot be $S$ since $e$ is the only bridge between these two components in $S$.  Therefore $S-e+f$ is once again a spanning tree. In fact $T-f+e$ is also still a tree.*\n",
    "\n",
    "So the set of spanning trees actually satisfies a **strong exchange property** and does indeed form a matroid.  This will give us a bit more machinery to prove that the greedy algorithm will produce an optimum. We'll use the fact that any independent set $I$ of a matroid can be extended to a basis $I\\subset B$.   \n",
    " \n",
    "The greedy algorithm (Kruskal's) is absurdly unsophisticated.  Since we are minimizing, we start by adding the smallest element to our set $T$.  At every iteration, we add the smallest element $e$ such that $T+e$ is stil independent (doesn't contain cycles).  And since this is a matroid, we know that at every iteration, our set of edges  $T_i$ is contained in a tree $B_i$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $w: E \\rightarrow \\bf{R}^+$ be the weight function on the edges.  Suppose $i$ is the first time where we make a set $T_i$ that is not contained in an optimal base $B_i$. Let $e$ be the element we add at this iteration.  Since $T_{i-1}\\subset B_{min}$ where $B_{min}$ is a MST, we can use the strong exchange property to replace an $f\\in B_{min}\\setminus T_{i-1}$ with $e$. However all such $f$ will have equal or larger weight than $e$ since $e$ minimizes $w(T_{i-1}+e)$ over all $e$ not forming a cycle.  But the minimality of $B_{min}$ implies that $w(f) \\leq w(e)$ proving that $w(B_i) = w(B_{min})$ for all $i$.  \n",
